Tech Infrastructure Demonstrations

This repository is my portfolio showcasing practical skills in Network Segmentation and Security Configuration. These are the foundational concepts I use for reliable data governance and compliance in security conscious environments.

These projects were created to demonstrate my ability to implement and document secure, scalable infrastructure solutions.

Projects:

Basic VLAN Segmentation (Cisco CLI)

Goal: To implement logical separation of internal network traffic.

Relevance: Ensuring sensitive data segregation (e.g. confidential client records or business plans) is segregated from standard traffic to meet audit requirements.

About Me

I recently completed my Diploma in Information Technology (Network and Cloud), which has given me a strong foundation in structured problem-solving and logical systems design. I am leveraging this analytical mindset as I prepare to start my Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in 2026.

Connect

I am actively interested in opportunities to apply my technical knowledge and analytical mindset in new environments.
